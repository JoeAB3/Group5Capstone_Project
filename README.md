# Predicting Number of Medals Won in the Summer Olympic Games by Participated Countries

In our final project, we are interested in analyze how different economic, social and/or political factors could impact the performance of countries when they participate in the Summer Olympic Games. The performance is quantify as the total number of medals won by each country in each Olympic Game.

## Reason we chose this topic:

The team is interested in economics and sports

## Questions we hope to answer with the data:

â€¢ Does a countries HDI rank, annual GDP growth, annual GNI growth, and total population contribute to a countries total medal count at the olympics 

## Communication Protocols:

*	Slack group containing all group members
*	Team meetings during scheduled class hours on Monday and Wednesday
*	Additional team meetings twice a week on zoom 
*	Individual GitHub branch for each team member


## 1. Data Exploration:

Economic and Political Indicators will be draw from the [**World Bank Data Catalog**](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/World-Development-Indicators) that has around 1453 indicators compiled from official sources around the world (204 countries are considered). The original data has initially been explored by using `Python-Pandas Library`. The jupyter notebook is found [here](https://github.com/JoeAB3/Group5Capstone_Project/blob/Leidybranch/pre-processingWBD.ipynb).  
In addition to this dataset, we have added another index from [**United Nations**](http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/137506#). This is the *Human Development Index(HDI)*, which "measures average achievement in three basic dimensions of human development: long and healthy life, knowledge and decent standard of living. 

With these two datasets we have created a joined dataframe that contains four indicators measured anually and for each country.  Because the HDI has been only reported since 1990, we are considered only the frame of time: 1990-2019.  

(Joe could add here the description of the Olympic data)


## 2. Machine Learning:

Our goal is to predict the total number of medals won by each country in the Summer Olympic Games. Our features are labeled, and our target is numerical. This lead us to decide to use a supervised machine learning model.

We have determined that our dependent variable will be a countries total medal count, and our independent variables will be a countries HDI Rank, gdp growth(annual), GNI growth (annual), and total population.

A random forest linear regression model will be used to try and forecast the total medal count. When researching which model to use, we learned that random forest algorithms have proven to be advantageous in sports forecasting. [Resource](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04378.pdf)

Random forest regression is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning for regression. Ensemble learning method is a technique that combines predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to make a more accurate prediction than a single model.  A Random Forest operates by constructing several decision trees during training time and outputting the mean of the classes as the prediction of all the trees.

## 3. Database:

Due to the nature of our data, we will use a PostgreSQL database to save our data sets. Our database will initially have two tables: `Indicators` and `OlympicMedals`. Below there is a rough schema of each table:

```psql
CREATE TABLE Indicators (
  Country_Code character(3) NOT NULL,
  GDP_growth integer NOT NULL,
  GNI_growth integer NOT NULL,
  Population integer NOT NULL,
  Year character NOT NULL,
  HDI integer NOT NULL,
  HDI_Rank integer NOT NULL,
);

Schema for Olympic Data
```
After we clean and pre-process the original datasets in Jupyter Notebook, we will write them to `PostgreSQL` tables.
While in `PgAdmin` we will need to create the database and tables with the schema presented above.
